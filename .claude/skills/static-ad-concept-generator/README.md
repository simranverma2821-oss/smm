### Category-Specific Concept Templates
Pre-built concept tables for DTC e-commerce, B2B/SaaS, health & wellness, beauty & skincare, and food & beverage. Each includes the concept name, headline template, and visual direction.

### Headline Formula Library
15+ fill-in-the-blank headline structures organized by driver: benefit, curiosity, social proof, comparison, and urgency. Tested across thousands of ad campaigns.

### Visual Direction Guide
10 static image styles (hero product, lifestyle, flat lay, before/after, infographic, testimonial card, comparison, text-heavy, UGC screenshot, ingredient/feature) with descriptions and best-use recommendations.
